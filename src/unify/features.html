        <h1 class="page-title">Why Unify?</h1>
        <p class="page-subtagline">Modern static sites with zero hassle.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="feature-details">
        <h2>Zero Learning Curve</h2>
        <p>Unify uses familiar include syntax (like
            <code>&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;header.html&quot; --&gt;</code> comments and
            <code>&lt;include src=&quot;header.html&quot;&gt;</code> tags) for templating, so you can start building
            immediately without learning new languages or frameworks.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Tooling</h2>
        <p>Under the hood, Unify is built with modern JavaScript and works on Node.js, Deno, and Bun. No heavy
            dependencies or complex bundlers &ndash; just a straightforward tool that fits into any workflow.</p>

        <h2>Live Reload &amp; Development Server</h2>
        <p>A built-in development server provides live reload via Server-Sent Events. Your changes appear instantly
            in the browser, keeping your development flow smooth and helping you iterate faster.</p>

        <h2>Flexible Content Support</h2>
        <p>Write content in HTML or Markdown (with YAML frontmatter for metadata). Unify seamlessly processes
            both, wrapping Markdown content with your layouts. Static assets like images or CSS are also tracked and
            copied automatically when referenced.</p>

        <h2>SEO Optimized</h2>
        <p>Unify automatically generates a <code>sitemap.xml</code> and lets you define a universal
            <code>head.html</code> include for meta tags and scripts. This means better SEO and easy integration of
            analytics or social tags with minimal effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Framework-Free Output</h2>
        <p>The output of Unify is pure static HTML, CSS, and assets. There's no client-side framework needed,
            which means your site is lean, fast, and can be hosted on any server or CDN. Just build and deploy.</p>
